# COVID-19-Analysis
In this project, I used various data sources and Python libraries to analyze the COVID-19 situation around the world and I explored the data and visualized the trends and patterns of the pandemic and also predicted the top 10 countries with the highest number of cases based on some parameters such as confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active cases.
